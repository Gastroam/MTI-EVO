By fixing the random number generator’s initial state with a specific seed, you guarantee that the same input data will always produce the exact same model weights, activations, and ultimately, the same output during training and evaluation. Without a fixed seed, each run of an experiment will be slightly different due to the inherent randomness of the random number generator"
