By setting a specific seed for the random number generator used throughout the training process – including data shuffling, weight initialization, and dropout – you ensure that the same input data and model architecture will always produce the exact same results. This allows researchers to reliably compare different experiments, debug issues, and verify that changes in the model are truly responsible for observed"
