PROMPT: Explain in one paragraph why deterministic seeds matter in neural experiments.
OK: True
LATENCY_MS: 10212.79
TOKENS: 80
RESPONSE:
Deterministic seeds are crucial in neural experiments because they ensure reproducibility. By fixing the random number generator’s initial state with a specific seed, you guarantee that the same input data will always produce the exact same model weights, activations, and ultimately, the same output during training and evaluation. Without a fixed seed, each run of an experiment will be slightly different due to the inherent randomness of the random number generator
