PROMPT: Explain in one paragraph why deterministic seeds matter in neural experiments.
OK: True
LATENCY_MS: 1679.93
TOKENS: 80
RESPONSE:
Deterministic seeds are crucial in neural experiments because they ensure reproducibility. By setting a specific seed for the random number generator used throughout the training process – including data shuffling, weight initialization, and dropout – you guarantee that the same input data and model architecture will always produce the exact same results. Without a fixed seed, even slight variations in the random number generation can lead to dramatically different model parameters, training dynamics,

PROMPT: Describe how eviction pressure impacts long-term memory stability in sparse attractor systems.
OK: True
LATENCY_MS: 1354.96
TOKENS: 80
RESPONSE:
Okay, let's delve into the fascinating intersection of eviction pressure, long-term memory, and sparse attractor systems. This is a relatively recent area of research in neuroscience, primarily driven by work on the hippocampus and related brain regions. Here's a breakdown of how eviction pressure impacts long-term memory stability in these systems, combining established theories with current thinking:

**1. Sparse Attractor
