By setting a specific seed for the random number generator used throughout the training process – including data shuffling, weight initialization, and dropout – you guarantee that the same input data and model architecture will always produce the exact same results. Without a fixed seed, even slight variations in the random number generation can lead to dramatically different model parameters, training dynamics,"
