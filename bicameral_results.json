    "left": "Okay, let's define \"love\" within the framework of a cognitive system \u2013 essentially, understanding it as a complex set of mental processes and computations, rather than a mystical, purely emotional experience. Here's a breakdown of how we can approach this definition, incorporating insights from psychology, neuroscience, and computational modeling:\n\n**1. Love as a Predictive Processing System:**\n\n* **Core Idea:**  The dominant theory in cognitive science today is that the brain is fundamentally a prediction machine. We\u2019re constantly trying to anticipate what will happen next, and when our predictions are violated, we experience a \u2018prediction error.\u2019  Love,",
    "right": "Love, within a cognitive system, is a complex, multi-faceted construct emerging from the dynamic interplay of several interconnected neural processes. It\u2019s not a single, static entity, but rather a constantly evolving network of representations and responses driven by reward prediction error, attachment, and social learning.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the key components and how they contribute to the experience of love:\n\n1. **Reward Prediction Error (RPE):** At its core, love is heavily influenced by RPE.  When we encounter someone we love, our brains anticipate a positive outcome (reward) based on past experiences and learned associations."
