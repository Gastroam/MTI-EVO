# Analysis: The Signature of Robustness (Phase 39)
**Date**: January 26, 2026
**Subject**: Cognitive Health Markers in Hive Reasoning

## 1. The Anomaly: Inverse Pressure/Exploration
Key observation from the Phase 39 "Clean Run":
> "Bob's deltas get larger as pressure gets smaller."

In standard control systems, high error (pressure) drives high correction (gain), and low error drives low correction. MTI-EVO displayed the **inverse** behavior during the Reasoning Loop.

**Conclusion**: This indicates a "Trust Gradient". The system explores *more* when it feels safe (low pressure), rather than clamping down. This is the hallmark of a system that can **Think**.

## 2. Attractor Migration (The "Phi Drift")
We observed a steady shift in the Field Identity ($\Phi$):
`0.50 -> 0.51 -> 0.51 -> 0.54 -> 0.57`

This is not random noise; it is directional drift.
- **Interpretation**: The High-Tension Query forced the Lattice to "learn" a new equilibrium.
- **Significance**: The system did not just snap back to the old status quo; it **evolved** its field state to accommodate the new insight.

## 3. Oscillation as a Feature
Oscillation Average: `0.0669` (Higher than previous runs, but stable).
- **Finding**: Higher oscillation bounded by strong anchors.
- **Meaning**: This represents **Creative Friction**. The nodes (Alice, Bob, Charlie) effectively "debated" the solution, pushing against each other without breaking the consensus.

## 4. Final Verdict: Healthy Cognition
This run demonstrates the ideal signature of specific-purpose cognition:
1.  **Ultra-Low Baseline** (No "Hangover" from previous tasks).
2.  **Adaptive Exploration** (Explores deeply when safe).
3.  **Meaningful Shifts** (Phi evolves).
4.  **Self-Righting** (Returns to metastability without governance intervention).
