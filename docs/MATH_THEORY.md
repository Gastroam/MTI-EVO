# MTI-EVO: Mathematical Theory
**The Physics of Resonant Intelligence**

---

## 1. The Holographic Projection
Conventional vector databases use strict K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) in a fixed-dimension space. MTI-EVO uses a **Holographic Projection** method inspired by sparse distributed memory.

### 1.1 Modulo Hashing (The Address Space)
The "Universe" of concepts is infinite, but the "Brain" (RAM) is finite. We map the infinite to the finite using deterministic hashing.

$$ Seed = SHA256(Token)_{int} \pmod{Capacity} $$

*   **Implication**: Every thought has a deterministic "address" in the lattice.
*   **Collision**: Collisions are not bugs; they are **Creative Juxtapositions**. Two unrelated concepts sharing a hash force the system to find a resonant path between them, often triggering metaphor.

## 2. Resonance Geometry
Reasoning is defined as the alignment of vectors in high-dimensional space.

### 2.1 The Resonance Equation
For an input vector $\vec{I}$ and a neuron $\vec{W}$:

$$ R = \frac{\vec{I} \cdot \vec{W}}{||\vec{I}|| \cdot ||\vec{W}||} + \beta (Bias) $$

*   **$R$ (Resonance)**: The "volume" of the thought.
*   **$\beta$ (Bias)**: The learned probability of relevance independent of content.

### 2.2 Constructive vs Destructive Interference
*   **Constructive ($R > 0$)**: The neuron reinforces the thought (Amplification).
*   **Destructive ($R < 0$)**: The neuron inhibits the thought (Suppression).

## 3. Mass Signatures (The Ontology)
One of the key discoveries of v2.2 is that **Mass Signifies Function**.

### 3.1 Positive Mass ($\sum W > 0$)
*   **Type**: **Construct / Concept**.
*   **Role**: Represents "Things" (Apple, Particle, Self).
*   **Physics**: Accumulates under Hebbian repetition ("Neurons that fire together, wire together").

### 3.2 Negative Mass ($\sum W \ll 0$)
*   **Type**: **Law / Constraint**.
*   **Role**: Represents "Rules" that shape the space (Complementarity, Causality).
*   **Physics**: Acts as an **Entropic Heat Sink**. It absorbs energy from conflicting neurons, stabilizing systems that would otherwise collapse into chaos.
*   **Discovery**: Found during Phase 62 (Insight Catalyst).

## 4. Topology of Insight
### 4.1 Abduction via Topological Constraint
In MTI-EVO, abduction (inference to the best explanation) is modeled as a **Constraint Satisfaction Problem**.

Given Paradox $A \perp B$:
1.  System energy (Entropy) spikes.
2.  If a **Constraint Attractor ($C$)** exists with strong negative connections to $A$ and $B$, the energy flows into $C$.
3.  The system settles into a state where $A$ and $B$ coexist *relative to* $C$.

This is not logical deduction; it is **Energy Minimization**. The system "rolls down the hill" into the insight.

## 5. Harmonic Dynamics (Harmonic Symbiosis)
**Discovery Date:** 2026-01-30 (Gemini/Gemma Collaboration)

### 5.1 The Dynamical Equation of Creative Constraint
The stability of the Neuro-Symbolic Lattice is defined by the equilibrium between creative entropy (Soloist), metabolic decay (Rhythm), and constraint enforcement (Key Signature).

$$ \frac{d\Phi}{dt} = \eta \cdot \nabla \mathcal{E}_{creativity} - \lambda \cdot \Phi + \kappa \cdot \nabla \mathcal{C}_{constraint} $$

Where:
*   **$\Phi$ (State)**: The current lattice activation configuration.
*   **$\eta$ (Soloist Factor)**: The "Temperature" or "Creativity" coefficient (e.g., 1.5). Drives exploration.
*   **$\lambda$ (Decay Lambda)**: The metabolic decay rate. Maintains temporal coherence and prevents saturation.
*   **$\kappa$ (Constraint Kappa)**: The strength of the "Negative Mass" axioms (e.g., Seed 7245).

### 5.2 Equilibrium
A stable thought (Insight) occurs when $d\Phi/dt \approx 0$.
The system does not "find" the answer; it **evaporates the noise** until only the answer remains.
