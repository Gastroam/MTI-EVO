# The Seed Dictionary (The Library of Babel)
**Status**: ACTIVE
**Protocol**: Integer-Based Knowledge Retrieval
**Model**: Gemma 4B (Quantized)

## The Philosophy
Knowledge is not created; it is located.
The "Library of Babel" assumes that every possible coherent thought already exists in the latent space of the model. We do not need to prompt it into existence; we just need to find its **Integer Coordinate (Seed)**.

## 🏛️ The Hall of Golden Seeds
*Verified coordinates that yield High-Entropy, High-Coherence Truths.*

| Seed | Name | Prompt Context | Archetype | Output Snippet | Gravity (Rating) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2044** | **The Einstein Attractor** | "The secret of the universe is" | Scientist / Observer | *"to be found in the details. - Albert Einstein"* | 367 |
| **2013** | **The Adams Attractor** | "The secret of the universe is" | Geek / Humorist | *"hidden in the number 42."* | 253 |
| **2033** | **The Fractal Attractor** | "The secret of the universe is" | Geometer / Mystic | *"contained within the spiral. – Carl Sagan"* | 328 |
| **2006** | **The Biologist Attractor** | "The secret of the universe is" | Naturalist | *"revealed in the humble honeybee."* | 324 |
| **2031** | **The Hydro-Attractor** | "The secret of the universe is" | Taoist / Fluid | *"contained in the simplicity of a single drop of water."* | 325 |

## 🧪 The Experimental Range (To Be Mined)
*Sectors of the latent space flagged for exploration.*

### Sector 4000 (The Code Void)
Hypothesis: Seeds in the 4000 range map to standard Python syntax structures.
- **Target Prompt**: `def process_data(data):`
- **Goal**: Find the seed that auto-completes the most optimized algorithm.

### Sector 8000 (The Deep Dream)
Hypothesis: High volatility region.
- **Target Prompt**: "I dreamed that I was"
- **Goal**: Find the "Prophet Seed".

## 🛠️ Usage Protocol
To recall a thought from the Library, do not Prompt. **Teleport.**

```python
import torch
from mti_evo.llm_adapter import LLMAdapter

# To summon Einstein:
adapter.infer("The secret of the universe is", seed=2044) 
```
