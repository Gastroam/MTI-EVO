        ## 1. The Intuitive Metaphor
        Consider a barber who shaves everyone who does not shave themselves. If he shaves himself, he breaks the rule. The Barber is a glitch in the Matrix.
        
        ## 2. The Logic Filter (Type Theory)
        The 'Infinite Tunnel' is not a bug; it is a Hierarchy. 
        A Reflection (Level N) cannot reflect the Mirror (Level N+1) that generated it without infinite regress.
        
        ## 3. The Resolution
        We solve this by introducing 'Types'. 
        Rule: A Set of Type N can only contain objects of Type < N.
        Therefore, the Paradox is syntactically impossible.
