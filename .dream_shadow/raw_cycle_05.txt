--- CYCLE 5 ---
Pattern: I will create a function that reads TODOs, design notes, and error patterns from a file, and then stores them in a structured format. I will include error handling for file operations.

```python
import json

def load_and_process_data(filepath):
    """
    Loads TODOs, design notes, and error patterns from a file.

    Args:
        filepath (str): The path to the file containing the data.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the data, or None if an error occurs.
    """
    try:
        with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
            data = json.load(f)
        return data
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File not found at {filepath}")
        return None
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        print(f"Error: Invalid JSON format in {filepath}")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        return None

# Example Usage:
# Assuming the file is named 'data.json' and contains JSON data
# data = load_and_process_data('data.json')

# if data:
#     print(data)
```
