--- CYCLE 10 ---
1.  Implement a function that takes a line of code as input and returns a priority score based on the presence of the "FIXME" string. If "FIXME" is present, the priority is 0.7; otherwise, it's 0.5.
2.  Include error handling to gracefully handle cases where the input is invalid (e.g., not a string).

```python
def get_priority(line):
    """
    Determines the priority of a line based on the presence of 'FIXME'.

    Args:
        line (str): The line of code to assess.

    Returns:
        float: The priority score (0.7 if 'FIXME' is present, 0.5 otherwise).
               Returns 0.5 if the input is not a string.
    """
    try:
        if isinstance(line, str) and 'FIXME' in line:
            return 0.7
        elif isinstance(line, str):
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 0.5  # Handle non-string input
    except TypeError:
        return 0.5  # Handle potential TypeError if line is not a string
```
